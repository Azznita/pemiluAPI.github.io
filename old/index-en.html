<p>As many as 180 million people are registered to vote in Indonesia's 2014 elections. An estimated 67 million of those people will be voting for the first time.</p>

<p>Voters need answers. Am I registered? Where do candidates stand on the issues that are important to me? How do I mark the ballot? What can I do if I'm having trouble voting?</p>

<p>To answer those questions, and many more, we're helping to build an open repository of information for Indonesian voters in 2014 &mdash; <span class="standout">an elections API</span>.</p>

<p>Developers will be able to use the API to build applications that do things like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>help people make sure they're registered to vote</li>
	<li>let your friends know you voted</li>
	<li>make an animated gif about an issue and share it</li>
	<li>remind you when a political event you want to attend is happening</li>
	<li>play fan-made videos about the candidates</li>
	<li>run a Twitter bot that tweets every time a candidate is mentioned in the news</li>
	<li>show you what the ballot will look like when you vote</li>
	<li>give you an election quiz and tweet your score</li>
	<li>help you report fraud or intimidation</li>

<h2>What's an API?</h2>

<p>An API is an <em>Application Programming Interface</em>. An interface is where two systems meet and interact. An API is an interface that an application uses to enable other applications to communicate with it.</p>

<p>The <span class="standout">Elections API 2014</span> will be an application that uses its interface to make information and functionality about Indonesia's 2014 elections available to other applications.</p>
